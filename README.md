# Portfolio Site, UQ Web Information Systems 2016

A professional portfilio website for INFS3202 Web Information Systems

This portfolio showcases the work of a musician friend of mine, with a photo gallery, embedded links to his music and a blog on the home page that can be updated by registed administrators. PHP is used for session control, blog retrieval, image upload and login verification. JavaScript was used for background animations and blog creation.
